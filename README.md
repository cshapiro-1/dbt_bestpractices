## Repo Structure:

This repo will serve as a centralized location for A8's best practices for dbt_.

There are folders within this repo that cover certain areas. They are as follows:

 - [Best Practices](best_practices): This will be the central hub for all best practices recommended by A8 in any dbt_ engagement. 
    - Project Structure
    - Model Design

 - [Training](training): This folder serves as the repository for all information on the internal A8 dbt_ training. It will include required tools, steps for training, when to check in with an instructor, and any other information related to training with dbt_.

 - [Macros](macros): This folder serves as the home to all macros that have been developed by A8 or posted in the community that we believe could be useful in projects. This does not include any macros found in the open source project dbtvault or the fishtown analytics repo dbt_utils.
